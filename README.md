Background
Galvanize Reads is a book catalog service that stores a list of recommended technology books. You are building a web app for them. It should allow you to:

List books and authors
Add books and authors
Modify books and authors
Remove books and authors
There are some additional features, such as search, that are nice-to-haves, but a lower priority than the core features. The folks at Galvanize Reads have provided you some sample data from their existing registry that you can use for development.

This app is using Node, Express and Postgres.
